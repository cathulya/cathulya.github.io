										<h2><a href="#">Text-to-Image Synthesis</a></h2>
									</header>
									<div class="image main"><img src="images\Field_Sparrow_0101_113762_s-1.png" alt="" /></div>
									<p>Text-to-image synthesis involves computational techniques that transform human-written textual descriptions into visual representations. A significant challenge in creating realistic objects with semantic details is the disparity between the high-level concepts in text descriptions and the pixel-level content required for synthetic images. To address these limitations, this project introduces the Attentional-PerStaGAN, a GAN-based T2I translator designed to bridge the cross-domain gap between visual and textual domains. This proposed model incorporates an attention module that focuses on the most relevant words within the textual descriptions. This attention mechanism, coupled with the integration of perceptual reconstruction loss and the Deep Attentional Multimodal Similarity Model loss, enhances the structural quality of the generated images. The model's performance is evaluated using the CUB bird dataset. The evaluation using metrics like IS and FID validates the perceptual quality improvements and the generalization ability of the proposed model.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Satellite Image to Digital Map Translation Using CGAN</a></h2>
									</header>
									<div class="image main"><img src="images\s1.jpg" alt="" /></div>
									<p>Recent advancements in deep learning algorithms have enabled the generation of realistic images. Notably, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have demonstrated promising outcomes in the domain of image-to-image translation. Introducing a novel approach, SatelliteGAN, aims to generate maps using satellite images. Leveraging the principles of Pix2Pix and CycleGAN, SatelliteGAN refines both the objective function and the architecture to achieve superior outcomes. By incorporating the perceptual reconstruction loss alongside pixel-level reconstruction loss, SatelliteGAN produces images with vivid colors and reduced blurriness. The perceptual reconstruction loss compels the generator to create samples that share similar feature representations with the ground truth. The model's effectiveness is assessed using the Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and its performance is compared against CycleGAN. Through these evaluations, a determination is made regarding which approach is more adept at generating models under comparable training conditions using the same map dataset.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Object Detection Using YOLO Models</a></h2>

									<div class="image main"><img src="images\welding.jpeg" alt="" /></div>
									<p>The goal is to check how well YOLO-based methods can accurately and quickly detect objects. To do this, using datasets that are available to the public. Trying out different YOLO versions, like YOLOv5, YOLOv8, and YOLO-NAS. Train these YOLO models with the datasets and then see how they do using certain measurements, like precision, recall, and mAP. These measurements help us understand how effective the models are at detecting objects.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Vibration Data Acquisition and Analysis of Aerospace System
											During Road Transportation Using Machine Learning Techniques</a></h2>
									</header>
									<div class="image main"><img src="images\sate1.jpg" alt="" /></div>
									<p>It has been observed that nearly half of the failures observed during the flights of satellite launch vehicles or missiles can be attributed to mechanical vibration and shock. One of the significant sources of mechanical vibration is the transportation of aerospace subassemblies between different sites. As a result, it's crucial to carefully account for these stresses during the early stages of equipment design and development. The proposed model includes a data acquisition system designed to measure vibration data. This system employs sensors placed at five different locations on the subassembly and collects data from these locations on a moving truck at a rate of around 1254 samples per second. The objective is to create a method for identifying transportation events using machine learning techniques. This proposed system aims to classify different road surface types and conditions by analyzing the temporal and spectral features of vibration signals obtained from roads. The identified road anomalies are then utilized for further studies on aerospace subassemblies and to enhance precautions in subsequent flights.</p>
